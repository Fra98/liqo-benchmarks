# Consumption benchmarks

This folder groups together the tools required to evaluate the liqo resource demands (CPU and RAM usage, as well as the network traffic generated towards remote Kubernetes API servers) in different operating conditions.
They are meant to be used in conjunction with the [liqo-k3s-cattle](../peering/liqo-k3s-cattle/) testing environment, and they can be enabled through the corresponding values file.

## Consumption measurer

[Consumption measurer](consumption-measurer) is a Go program that leverages the containerd APIs to retrieve the CPU and RAM usage statistics of the liqo-related pods.

## Network measurer

[Network measurer](network-measurer) is a Go program that leverages the pcap packet capture library to measure the amount of traffic generated towards a given set of destinations.
It is mainly thought to characterize the network traffic generated by the liqo components towards the Kubernetes API servers of remote clusters.

## Scripts

The [scripts](scripts) folder includes a set of scripts to automatically download the resulting outcome from the different clusters, as well as to post-process the results and retrieve the most relevant information for subsequent analysis.
